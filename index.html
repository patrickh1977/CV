        <p>
          <strong><a href="https://eslan.com.au">Patrick Hayeck</a></strong> is a pronunciation guru, a renowned English teacher in Sydney, Australia who developed a revolutionary method of English teaching based on his jaw-dropping story as an
          English
          learner. Hayeck started learning English at the age of
          22. Completely self-taught, he achieved native-like proficiency in English in just 18 months. He went on to create the BBR method and several government-accredited English courses focusing on speaking, listening and pronunciation changing
          hundreds of students’ lives.
